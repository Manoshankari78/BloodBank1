Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
If you have the project in a Git repository, clone it:
git clone <repository-url>
cd blood-donation-management-system

If youâ€™re not using Git, ensure your project files are in D:\blood-donation-management-system.
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Node.js packages:
npm install

This will install express, mysql2, bcrypt, node-fetch, and other dependencies listed in package.json.
3. Set Up the MySQL Database

Start MySQL: Ensure your MySQL server is running.
Create the Database:
Connect to MySQL:mysql -u <username> -p

Enter your password.
Create the database:CREATE DATABASE blood_donation;




Create Tables:
Run the schema.sql file to create the necessary tables:mysql -u <username> -p blood_donation < database/schema.sql


Alternatively, copy the contents of schema.sql and run them in your MySQL client.



4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=<your-mysql-username>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-mysql-password>
DB_NAME=blood_donation
PORT=3000

Replace <your-mysql-username> and <your-mysql-password> with your MySQL credentials.
5. Register an Admin User
Before using the admin functionality, you need to register an admin user.

Create a Script:
Create a file named register-admin.js in the root directory with the following content:const fetch = require('node-fetch');

async function registerAdmin() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/users/register/admin', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        username: 'admin',
        password: 'admin123',
      }),
    });

    const result = await response.json();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error registering admin:', error);
  }
}

registerAdmin();




Run the Script:
Start the server in one terminal:node server/app.js


In another terminal, run the script:node register-admin.js


You should see:{ message: 'Admin registered successfully.' }




Verify in Database:
Check the Admin table:SELECT * FROM Admin;





6. Start the Server
Run the server:
node server/app.js

You should see:
ðŸš€ Server is running at http://localhost:3000
âœ… Connected to MySQL Database

Usage
1. Access the Application

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
Youâ€™ll see the homepage (index.html) with options to register or log in.

2. Register Users

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/register.html.
Register as a Donor or Recipient by filling out the form.

3. Log In

Go to http://localhost:3000/login.html.
Log in as:
Donor: Use the email and password you registered with.
Recipient: Use the phone number and password you registered with.
Admin: Use username: admin and password: admin123 (or the credentials you set).



4. Dashboard Features

Donor Dashboard:
View notifications for urgent blood requests.
Respond to urgent requests (accept/decline).
Schedule a donation.
View donation history.
Search for available blood.


Recipient Dashboard:
Request blood (with optional urgency).
View request history.


Admin Dashboard:
Manage blood inventory (update quantities and expiry dates).
Approve or reject pending blood requests.
View donor responses to urgent requests.



Testing

Donor:
Register and log in as a donor.
Schedule a donation and verify it appears in the donation history.
Respond to an urgent request and check the updated notification status.


Recipient:
Register and log in as a recipient.
Submit a blood request and verify it appears in the request history.


Admin:
Log in as an admin.
Update blood inventory and check the database.
Approve/reject a blood request and verify the status updates.



Database Schema
The database schema (database/schema.sql) includes the following tables:

Donor: Stores donor information.
Recipient: Stores recipient information.
Admin: Stores admin credentials.
Blood_Inventory: Tracks available blood by blood group.
Blood_Request: Stores blood requests from recipients.
Donation: Stores scheduled donations by donors.
Notifications: Stores notifications for donors.
Donor_Response: Tracks donor responses to urgent requests.

Troubleshooting

Server Fails to Start:
Check your .env file for correct database credentials.
Ensure MySQL is running and the blood_donation database exists.


"Admin already exists":
Delete the existing admin user:DELETE FROM Admin WHERE Username = 'admin';


Rerun register-admin.js.


"Table doesn't exist":
Ensure you ran schema.sql to create all tables.


"fetch is not a function":
Ensure node-fetch is installed (npm install node-fetch@2).
Verify the script uses the correct import for your Node.js version.



Future Enhancements

JWT Authentication: Add token-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
Email/SMS Notifications: Send notifications via email or SMS for urgent requests.
Deployment: Deploy the application to a platform like Render or Heroku.
